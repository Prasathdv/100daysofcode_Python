# 100daysofcode_Python

Python Learning from beginner to Advanced. 100 days of code challenge. 100 projects in 100 days.

### Day 1: November 10. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of Python string manipulation.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/Prasathdv/100daysofcode_Python/tree/main/Day%2001%20-%20Band%20Name%20Generator)

### Day 2: November 11. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of Python formatted strings , basic data types and maths calculation.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** [Tip calculator](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/tip-calculator-start)

### Day 3: November 12. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of Python if conditions , booleans. Created a sample Treasure game using this concept.

**Thoughts:** Gained confidence by cracking few logics (Love calculator, Leap year).

**Link to work:** [Treasure Island Game](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/treasure-island-start#main.py)

### Day 4: November 14. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned Randomization and List data type. Created RPS(Rock papers Scissors)game using this logic.

**Thoughts:** Gained confidence by cracking few gamelogics (RPS game and Treasure chest find game).

**Link to work:** [RPS Game](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/rock-paper-scissors-start#main.py)

### Day 5: November 15. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned for loop and range. created a random password generator using this logic.

**Thoughts:** Tough day in office!!. Quite a challenging tasks which require lot of rework and logic (Highest number in a given list, password generator)

**Link to work:** [Password Generator](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/password-generator-start#main.py)

### Day 6: November 16. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned while loop.

**Thoughts:** Another tough day in office!!. Solving huddle race and variable height huddle race was really challenging though it uses simple while and If loop. Final Maze game was really tough to crack.

**Link to work:** [Maze game](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)

### Day 7: November 16. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a Hangman game using loops(for, while), conditions, methods.

**Thoughts:** Game concept was neatlly drafted in a flow chart which helped a lot to structure the code. Learned few new concepts in loops ( using 'not in' , "\_" )

**Link to work:** [Hangman game](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/Day-7-Hangman-5-Start#main.py)

### Day 8: November 17. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created a Caesar`s Cipher encryptrion module using functions with input and index().

**Thoughts:** This was pretty easy as compared with previous excercise.

**Link to work:** [Caesar`s Cipher Encryption](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/caesar-cipher-4-start#main.py)

### Day 9: November 18. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created Silent Auction game which predicts highest bidder.This uses dictionary and nesting dictionary with lists and dictionary concepts.

**Thoughts:** This was easy stage as compared with previous excercise.

**Link to work:** [Silent Auction](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/blind-auction-start#main.py)

### Day 10: November 19. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created Calculator using functions with output and recursion concept.

**Thoughts:** This is also an easier module compared to previous days. Learnt a lot of new finer coding techniques. Still my coding logics are raw and repetitive and needs fine tune.

**Link to work:** [Calculator](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/calculator-start#main.py)

### Day 11: November 20. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Created Blackjack game as my first capstone project using all concepts learned so for.

**Thoughts:** With the given hints and flowchart I could able to generate desired output. Learnt few nuances in looping and conditions.

**Link to work:** [Blackjack Game](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/blackjack-start#main.py)

### Day 12: November 21. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Created Number guessing game from scratch right from logic setting, flowchart to actual code.

**Thoughts:** Faced challenges in looping and conditions. tried multiple attempts to get right logic.

**Link to work:** [Number Guessing Game](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/guess-the-number-final#main.py)

### Day 13: November 22. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today learnt how to debug codes with bugs.

**Thoughts:** Learnt how to debug code using [debugging tool](http://www.pythontutor.com/).

**Link to work:** [FizzBuzz](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/day-13-3-exercise-1#main.py)

### Day 14: November 23. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today created Higher or Lower games loosely based on [Higher Or Lower Game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/).

**Thoughts:** Learnt how to deconstruct logics to smaller chunks before starting to code. Got struck on game repetability model. Final output is satisfactory as it was close to what i coded.

**Link to work:** [HigherorLower](https://repl.it/@Prasathdv/higher-lower-start#main.py)
